Proposition:

Our current Electron application built with Vite and React has successfully implemented logging and annotation features.
However, integrating a webview to open external URLs has proven problematic due to CORS restrictions—external URLs are 
blocked when loaded directly from the renderer context.

Continue Pursuing Vite + React with Workarounds?

Proposed Workarounds:

Separate BrowserWindow: Open external URLs in a dedicated Electron BrowserWindow with a preload script. This window 
would use the native Electron webview (or directly load the URL) to bypass CORS.  Main Process Fetching: Handle external 
requests in the main process using Node APIs (e.g., node-fetch), then pass the fetched content to the renderer.
Hybrid Approach: Maintain the React UI while isolating webview functionality in a separate window or via iframes 
configured with Electron’s webPreferences (ensuring webviewTag: true).

Implications:

Advantages:
Leverages modern Vite + React tooling.
Maintains a consistent React-based UI for internal components.
Disadvantages:
Increases architectural complexity by splitting functionality between renderer and main processes.
Requires additional IPC bridging and maintenance overhead.
Workarounds might not be as seamless as native integration.

Continuing with Vite + React offers modern development benefits but requires additional engineering effort to reliably 
integrate external URL loading (via workarounds like a separate BrowserWindow or main-process fetching). Removing 
external URL components simplifies the stack but may compromise core functionality. The decision should be based on 
whether maintaining external scraping is essential to the application’s purpose or if a more internalized solution can 
meet project requirements.
