Welcome to the documentation for the J-Initiative Web Scraper. This tool supports data scraping, annotation workflows, and database integration — all within an Electron-powered interface.

> 🚨 **Notice:**  
> For security reasons, the Database tab and frontend interface have been disabled in the current release.  
> Backend database functionality (e.g., adding, modifying, and deleting entries via Firebase) remains available and documented.  
> Future developers can re-enable the Database page if appropriate security measures are applied.
