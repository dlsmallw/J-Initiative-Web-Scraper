#  Additional  tools to integrate into the CI/CD Configuration 

This document provides examples and explanations for configuring testing, linting, and code coverage for a Python  
and npm-based web scraping application.

## 1. Python Configuration

### 1.1. PyTest for Unit Testing



```bash
pip install pytest
```

`test_sample.py` for a sample test:

```python
# test_sample.py

def test_example():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4
```

Test locally:

```bash
pytest
```

### 1.2. Coverage.py for Code Coverage

Install coverage.py to generate coverage reports:

```bash
pip install coverage
```

Run the tests with coverage enabled:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report  # To print the coverage report to the console
coverage html    # To generate an HTML coverage report
```

Commands for CI/CD pipeline to ensure tests are run and coverage is generated on every pull request:

```yaml
# In the GitHub Actions CI pipeline

- name: Run Python Unit Tests
  run: |
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    coverage run -m pytest
    coverage report
```

## 2. npm Configuration

### 2.1. ESLint for JavaScript Linting

Set up linting for JavaScript code with ESLint:

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

Initialize an ESLint configuration:

```bash
npx eslint --init
```

Create a `.eslintrc.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es6": true
  },
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2018,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "warn",
    "no-console": "off"
  }
}
```

Create a sample JavaScript file for testing:

```javascript
// sample.js

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Run ESLint locally:

```bash
npx eslint sample.js
```

### 2.2. nyc for Code Coverage

For JavaScript code coverage, **nyc** is commonly used:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nyc
```

Add a coverage script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha --reporter spec",
    "coverage": "nyc npm test"
  }
}
```

Run the coverage command:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

Add commands to the CI/CD pipeline to lint JavaScript files and ensure coverage reports are generated:

```yaml
# In the GitHub Actions CI pipeline 

- name: Run ESLint on JavaScript Files
  run: |
    npm install
    npx eslint .

- name: Run JavaScript Unit Tests and Coverage
  run: |
    npm install
    npm run coverage
```

## 3. Example GitHub Actions CI Configuration

Below is an example of a GitHub Actions YAML configuration that integrates the above Python and npm tools into the CI/CD pipeline.

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Python setup and testing
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install Python dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run Python Unit Tests and Coverage
      run: |
        coverage run -m pytest
        coverage report
        coverage xml

    # JavaScript setup, linting, and testing
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install npm dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Lint JavaScript Files with ESLint
      run: |
        npm install
        npx eslint .

    - name: Run JavaScript Tests and Coverage
      run: npm run coverage
```

This pipeline will:

- Run Python tests with PyTest and generate a code coverage report.
- Lint JavaScript files with ESLint.
- Run JavaScript unit tests and generate a coverage report using nyc.
