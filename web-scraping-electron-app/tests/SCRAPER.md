## **Instructions: Web Scraper**

### **1. Open the Application**
- Launch the web scraper application from your desktop or development environment.
- The default landing page is the **Home** page. Use the **Scraper** navigation button to open the scraping interface.

---

### **2. Enter a URL**
- Go to the **Scraper** page.
- In the **URL Mode**, enter the web page URL you want to scrape into the input field labeled **"URL of Web Page"**.
- Click the **Submit** button to load the web page inside the embedded webview.

---

### **3. Interact with the Webview**
- Once the web page loads in the webview:
  - Navigate the page as needed.
  - Highlight any text or data you want to scrape.

---

### **4. Import Selected Data**
- After selecting the text in the webview:
  - Click the **Import** button to transfer the selected text into the **Scraped Data** textarea on the interface.
  - The imported text will appear in the **Scraped Data** section below the buttons.

---

### **5. Export Scraped Data**
- Once you have the scraped data:
  - Click the **Export** button to send the data to the main application or save it.
  - The data is automatically processed for the **Formatted Data** and **Raw Data** containers on the **Scraper** page.
  - These containers will display processed and raw versions of the imported data.

---

### **6. Clear Scraped Data**
- To reset the **Scraped Data** section:
  - Click the **Clear** button to remove all data from the textarea.
  - This action does not impact any exported or saved data.

---

### **7. Toggle Developer Tools (Optional)**
- If you need to debug or inspect the webview:
  - Use the **Open DevTools** button (or press **Ctrl+Shift+I**) to open the developer tools for the webview.

---

### **8. Switch Between Modes**
- **Manual Mode**: If you prefer to manually input data instead of scraping:
  - Click the **Manual Mode** toggle button.
  - Input your data directly into the provided text box and export it.

---

### **9. Troubleshooting**
- **URL Fails to Load**: Ensure the URL is valid and starts with `http://` or `https://`.
- **No Data to Export**: Ensure youâ€™ve selected text in the webview or manually entered data.
- **Developer Tools Not Opening**: Ensure the application has focus when toggling DevTools.

---

### **Notes**
- **Data Containers**:
  - **Formatted Data**: Automatically processed version of your scraped data.
  - **Raw Data**: Unprocessed, as-is data from your scrape.
- **Safety**: Avoid scraping sensitive or copyrighted information without proper permissions.
